# Java Dynamic SQS Listener Core
This is the core implementation of the Dynamic SQS Listener API. This contains basic implementations that should cover a
significant amount of use cases but if it doesn't the consumer can easily implement their own.

## Usage

See [java-dynamic-sqs-listener-core-examples](../examples/core-examples) for examples of
using this core code to listen to a queue.

## More Information?

For more information you can look at the root project [README.md](../README.md) which provides more information about 
the architecture of the application. The [API](../java-dynamic-sqs-listener-api) is also a good location to find more
information about what each part of the framework is how they interact with each other.
