# AWS XRay Spring Example

This shows an example of integrating into AWS XRay Tracing using a local XRay Daemon and AWS resources such as SQS, SNS and S3.

## Steps

1. Create an IAM User with Access to write to SNS, SQS and Xray.
1. Obtain an Access Key and Secret Key for this user.
1. Create a SQS queue with default settings. Copy the Queue URL and put it in the `sqs.queue.url` [application.yml](src/main/resources/application.yml)
property.
1. Create a new SNS Topic in the same region as the SQS queue and place the SNS ARN in the `sns.arn` [application.yml](src/main/resources/application.yml)
property.
1. Create a subscription from the SNS Topic to SQS, this will mean any messages added to the SNS topic will create a message in the SQS Queue.
1. Run a local XRay Daemon by following this [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-daemon-local.html), making sure you set the access
key and secret key in your ~/.aws/credentials file like:

    ```text
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = {keyHere}
    aws_secret_access_key = {secretHere}
    ```

1. Run the application replacing the variables with your access keys

    ```bash
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={keyHere} AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={secretHere} AWS_REGION={sqsRegionHere} gradle bootRun
    ```

1. You should now see messages processing logs for messages directly sent to SQS or via SNS, as well as placing traces into Xray
