# Spring Starter Minimal Example

An example of setting up the [Spring Starter](../../spring/spring-starter) module in a Spring Application to show the minimal use case of connecting to
a local ElasticMQ server. It will periodically send messages to the queue and log these in the message listener.

## Usage

```bash
gradle bootRun
```
