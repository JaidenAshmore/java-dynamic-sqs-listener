The Java Dynamic SQS Listener is a library that simplifies the listening of messages on an [AWS SQS queue](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/).  It has been
built from the ground up with the goal of making it easily customisable, allowing each component of the library to be easily interchanged if desired, as well
as allowing dynamic changes to configuration during runtime, for example it could be extended to allow the amount of concurrent processing messages to be
controlled by a feature flag.

## Spring Boot Quick Guide

The following provides some examples using the Spring Boot Starter for this library. *Note that [core](./core) implementation is framework agnostic and
therefore is not reliant on Spring.*

### Using the Spring Boot Starter

This guide will give a quick guide to getting started for Spring Boot using the Spring Stater.

#### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.jashmore</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-dynamic-sqs-listener-spring-starter</artifactId>
    <version>${sqs.listener.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Gradle

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.jashmore:java-dynamic-sqs-listener-spring-starter:${sqs.listener.version}")
}
```

In one of your beans, attach a
[@QueueListener](./spring/spring-core/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/spring/container/basic/QueueListener.java)
annotation to a method indicating that it should process messages from a queue.

```java
@Service
public class MyMessageListener {
    @QueueListener("${insert.queue.url.here}") // The queue here can point to your SQS server, e.g. a local SQS server or one on AWS
    public void processMessage(@Payload final String payload) {
        // process the message payload here
    }
}
```

This will use any configured `SqsAsyncClient` in the application context for connecting to the queue, otherwise a default
will be provided that will look for AWS credentials/region from multiple areas, like the environment variables.

See [How to connect to AWS SQS Queues](./doc/how-to-guides/how-to-connect-to-aws-sqs-queue.md) for information about connecting to an actual queue in SQS.

## Core Infrastructure

This library has been divided into four main components each with distinct responsibilities. The following is a diagram describing a simple flow of a
single SQS message flowing through each of the components to eventually be executed by some code.

![Core Framework Architecture Diagram](./doc/resources/architecture_diagram.png "Core Framework Architecture Diagram")

Details about each component is:

- The [MessageRetriever](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/retriever/MessageRetriever.java) handles
obtaining messages from the SQS queue. This can optimise the retrieval of messages by batching requests for messages or prefetching messages before
they are needed.
- The [MessageProcessor](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/processor/MessageProcessor.java) controls
the processing of a message from the queue by delegating it to the corresponding Java method that handles the message.
- The [ArgumentResolverService](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/argument/ArgumentResolverService.java) is used by the
[MessageProcessor](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/processor/MessageProcessor.java) to populate the
arguments of the message listener method. For example, a parameter with the
[@Payload](./core/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/argument/payload/Payload.java) annotation will be resolved with the
body of the message cast to that type (e.g. a POJO).
- The [MessageBroker](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/broker/MessageBroker.java) is the main container that controls the whole flow
of messages from the [MessageRetriever](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/retriever/MessageRetriever.java) to the
[MessageProcessor](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/processor/MessageProcessor.java). It can determine when more messages
are to be processed and the rate of concurrency for processing messages.
- The [MessageResolver](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/resolver/MessageResolver.java) is used after successful processing of the message and its
responsibility is to remove the message from the SQS queue, so it is not processed again if there is a re-drive policy.

For more information about the core implementations provided by this library, see the [Core Implementations Overview](./doc/core-implementations-overview.md).

## Dependencies

The framework relies on the following dependencies and therefore it is recommended to upgrade the applications dependencies to a point somewhere near these
for compatibility.

- [Core Framework](./core)
  - JDK 1.8 or higher
  - [AWS SQS SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html)
  - [Jackson Databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind)
- [Spring Framework](./spring)
  - All the core dependencies above
  - [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot)
  
See the [build.gradle.kts](build.gradle.kts) for the specific versions of these dependencies.

## Common Use Cases/Explanations

### How to de-serialise a JSON Payload

The core library by default uses [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) to de-serialise the message payload and therefore you can
use any Jackson compatible POJO class.

```java
@Service
public class MyMessageListener {
    @QueueListener(value = "${insert.queue.url.here}")
    public void processMessage(@Payload final MyPojo payload) {
        // process the message payload here
    }

    public static class MyPojo {
        private String name;

        public MyPojo() {
            this.name = null;
        }

        public MyPojo(String name) {
            this.name = null;
        }

        public void setName(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }
    }
}
```

### Adding a custom argument resolver

There are some core [ArgumentResolvers](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/argument/ArgumentResolver.java) provided in the
application but custom ones can be defined if they don't cover your use case. As an example, the following is how we can populate the message listener
argument with the payload in uppercase.

1. We will use an annotation on the field to indicate how the message should be resolved.

    ```java
    @Retention(value = RUNTIME)
    @Target(ElementType.PARAMETER)
    public @interface UppercasePayload {
    }
    ```

1. Implement the [ArgumentResolver](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/argument/ArgumentResolver.java) interface where it will
do the logic for converting the message payload to uppercase.

    ```java
        public class UppercasePayloadArgumentResolver implements ArgumentResolver<String> {
            @Override
            public boolean canResolveParameter(MethodParameter methodParameter) {
                return methodParameter.getParameter().getType().isAssignableFrom(String.class)
                    && AnnotationUtils.findParameterAnnotation(methodParameter, UppercasePayload.class).isPresent();
           }

           @Override
           public String resolveArgumentForParameter(QueueProperties queueProperties, Parameter parameter, Message message) throws ArgumentResolutionException {
               return message.body().toUppercase();
           }
        }
    ```

    You may be curious why we use a custom `AnnotationUtils.findParameterAnnotation` function instead of getting the annotation directly from the parameter.
    The reason for this is due to potential proxying of beans in the application, such as by applying Aspects around your code via CGLIB.  As libraries, like
    CGLIB, won't copy the annotations to the proxied classes the resolver needs to look through the class hierarchy to find the original class to get the
    annotations. For more information about this, take a look at the JavaDoc provided in
    [AnnotationUtils](./util/annotation-utils/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/util/annotation/AnnotationUtils.java). You can also see an example of
    testing this problem in
    [PayloadArgumentResolver_ProxyClassTest.java](./core/src/test/java/com/jashmore/sqs/argument/payload/PayloadArgumentResolver_ProxyClassTest.java).
1. Include the custom [ArgumentResolver](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/argument/ArgumentResolver.java) in the application
context for automatic injection into the
[ArgumentResolverService](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/argument/ArgumentResolverService.java).

     ```java
     @Configuration
     public class MyCustomConfiguration {
        @Bean
        public UppercasePayloadArgumentResolver uppercasePayloadArgumentResolver() {
            return new UppercasePayloadArgumentResolver();
        }
     }
     ```

1. Use the new annotation in your message listener

    ```java
    @Component
    public class MyService {
        @QueueListener("${insert.queue.url.here}") // The queue here can point to your SQS server, e.g. a local SQS server or one on AWS
        public void processMessage(@UppercasePayload final String uppercasePayload) {
            // process the message payload here
        }
    }
    ```

For a more extensive guide for doing this, take a look at
[Spring - How to add a custom Argument Resolver](doc/how-to-guides/spring/spring-how-to-add-custom-argument-resolver.md).

### Increasing the concurrency limit

There is no limit to the number of messages that can be processed in the application and therefore you can process as many messages as threads your
application can handle. Therefore, if you are fine spinning up as many threads as concurrent messages, you can increase
the concurrency to as high of a value as you wish.

Using the Spring Boot Starter you could increase the number of concurrent messages to 100 like the following:

```java
@Service
public class MyMessageListener {
    @QueueListener(value = "${insert.queue.url.here}", concurrencyLevel = 100)
    public void processMessage(@Payload final String payload) {
        // some high IO processing here
    }
}
```

If there are not enough messages to reach this concurrency, there will be a lot of idle threads in the application.

### How to Mark the message as successfully processed

When the method executing the message finishes without throwing an exception, the
[MessageProcessor](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/processor/MessageProcessor.java) will acknowledge the message
as a success, therefore removing it from the queue. When the method throws an exception, the message will not be acknowledged and if there is a re-drive
policy the queue will perform another attempt of processing the message.

```java
@Service
public class MyMessageListener {
    @QueueListener(value = "queue-name")
    public void processMessage(@Payload final String payload) {
        // do nothing; so the message is considered successfully processed
    }
}
```

Note that if the method contains an
[Acknowledge](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/processor/argument/Acknowledge.java) argument it is now up to the method
to manually acknowledge the message as a success as the [MessageProcessor](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/processor/MessageProcessor.java)
will not acknowledge the message automatically when the method executes without throwing an exception.

```java
@Service
public class MyMessageListener {
    @QueueListener(value = "${insert.queue.url.here}", concurrencyLevel = 10, maxPeriodBetweenBatchesInMs = 2000)
    public void processMessage(@Payload final String payload, final Acknowledge acknowledge) {
        if (someCondition()) {
            CompletableFuture<?> future = acknowledge.acknowledgeSuccessful();
            future.get();
        }
    }
}
```

### Setting up a queue listener that batches requests for messages

The [Spring Cloud AWS Messaging](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-aws/tree/master/spring-cloud-aws-messaging) `@SqsListener` works by requesting
a set of messages from the SQS and when they are done it will request some more. There is one disadvantage with this approach in that if 9/10 of the messages
finish in 10 milliseconds but one takes 10 seconds no other messages will be picked up until that last message is complete. The
[@QueueListener](./spring/spring-core/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/spring/container/basic/QueueListener.java)
provides the same basic functionality, but it also provides a timeout where eventually it will request for more messages even for the threads that are
ready for another message. It will also batch the removal of messages from the queue and therefore with a concurrency level of 10, if there are a lot of
messages on the queue, only 2 requests would be made to SQS for retrieval and deletion of messages. The usage is something like this:

```java
@Service
public class MyMessageListener {
    @QueueListener(value = "${insert.queue.url.here}", concurrencyLevel = 10, maxPeriodBetweenBatchesInMs = 2000)
    public void processMessage(@Payload final String payload) {
        // process the message payload here
    }
}
```

In this example above we have set it to process 10 messages at once and when there are threads wanting more messages it will wait for a maximum of 2 seconds
before requesting messages for threads waiting for another message.

### Setting up a queue listener that prefetches messages

When the amount of messages for a service is extremely high, prefetching messages may be a way to optimise the throughput of the application. The
[@PrefetchingQueueListener](./spring/spring-core/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/spring/container/prefetch/PrefetchingQueueListener.java)
annotation can be used to prefetch messages in a background thread while processing the existing messages.  The usage is something like this:

```java
@Service
public class MyMessageListener {
    @PrefetchingQueueListener(value = "${insert.queue.url.here}", concurrencyLevel = 10, desiredMinPrefetchedMessages = 5, maxPrefetchedMessages = 10)
    public void processMessage(@Payload final String payload) {
        // process the message payload here
    }
}
```

In this example, if the amount of prefetched messages is below the desired amount of prefetched messages it will try to get as many messages as possible up
to the maximum specified.

*Note: because of the limit of the number of messages that can be obtained from SQS at once (10), having the maxPrefetchedMessages more than
10 above the desiredMinPrefetchedMessages will not provide much value as once it has prefetched more than the desired prefetched messages it will
not prefetch anymore.*

### Adding Brave Tracing

If you are using Brave Tracing in your application, for example using Spring Sleuth, you can hook into this system by including the
[brave-message-processing-decorator](extensions/brave-message-processing-decorator) extension.

See
[Core - How to add Brave Tracing](doc/how-to-guides/core/core-how-to-add-brave-tracing.md) and
[Spring - How to add Brave Tracing](doc/how-to-guides/spring/spring-how-to-add-brave-tracing.md) for guides on how to add tracing.

### Building a custom queue listener annotation

The core Queue Listener annotations may not provide the exact use case necessary for the application and therefore it can be useful to provide your
own annotation. See
[Spring - How to add a custom queue wrapper](doc/how-to-guides/spring/spring-how-to-add-own-queue-listener.md) for a guide to doing this.

### Versioning Message Payloads using Apache Avro Schemas

As the application grows, it may be beneficial to allow for versioning of the schema so that the consumer can still serialize messages from producers sending
different versions of the schema. To allow for this the [spring-cloud-schema-registry-extension](extensions/spring-cloud-schema-registry-extension) was written
to support this functionality. See the [README.md](extensions/spring-cloud-schema-registry-extension/README.md) for this extension for more details.

### Wrapping the Message Listener execution using a MessageProcessingDecorator

If you require to wrap the message listeners with some custom logic, like metrics, logging or other functionality, you can do this using a
[MessageProcessingDecorator](./api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/decorator/MessageProcessingDecorator.java). This provides callback
functions that will be executed at certain stages of the message processing lifecycle.  For more information on use cases and implementations, take a
look at [Core - How to create a message processing decorator](doc/how-to-guides/core/core-how-to-create-a-message-processing-decorator.md).

### Comparing Libraries

If you want to see the difference between this library and others like the
[Spring Cloud AWS Messaging](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-aws/tree/master/spring-cloud-aws-messaging) and
[Amazon SQS Java Messaging Library](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sqs-java-messaging-lib), take a look at the [sqs-listener-library-comparison](./examples/sqs-listener-library-comparison)
module. This allows you to test the performance and usage of each library for different scenarios, such as heavy IO message processing, etc.

## Examples

See [examples](./examples) for all the available examples.

### Testing locally an example Spring Boot app with the Spring Starter

The easiest way to see the framework working is to run one of the examples locally. These use an in memory [ElasticMQ](https://github.com/adamw/elasticmq)
SQS Server to simplify getting started. For example to run a sample Spring Application you can use the
[Spring Starter Example](examples/spring-starter-examples/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/examples).

1. Build the framework

```bash
gradle build -x test -x integrationTest
```

1. Run the Spring Starer Example Spring Boot app

```bash
(cd examples/spring-starter-examples && gradle bootRun)
```

### Testing locally a dynamic concurrency example

This shows an example of running the SQS Listener in a Java application that will dynamically change the concurrency level while it is executing.

This examples works by having a thread constantly placing new messages while the SQS Listener will randomly change
the rate of concurrency every 10 seconds.

1. Build the framework

```bash
gradle build -x test -x integrationTest
```

1. Run the Spring Starer Example Spring Boot app

```bash
(cd examples/core-examples && gradle runApp)
```

### Connecting to multiple AWS Accounts using the Spring Starter

If the Spring Boot application needs to connect to SQS queues across multiple AWS Accounts, you will need to provide a
[SqsAsyncClientProvider](./spring/spring-api/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/spring/client/SqsAsyncClientProvider.java)
which will be able to obtain a specific `SqsAsyncClient` based on an identifier. For more information on how to do this, take a look at the documentation
at [How To Connect to Multiple AWS Accounts](doc/how-to-guides/spring/spring-how-to-connect-to-multiple-aws-accounts.md).
