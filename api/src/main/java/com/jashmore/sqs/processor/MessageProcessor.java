/**
 * Processor that has the responsibility of taking a message and processing it via the required message consumer (Java method).
 *
 * <p>This wraps a Java method that should be executed for each message received. The parameters of the function will need to be extracted out
 * of the message and the implementations of this {@link MessageProcessor} should use the {@link ArgumentResolverService} to do this. For example, an argument
 * may require the message id of the message and therefore this would handle populating the argument for this parameter with this value.
 *
 * <p>Most arguments would be able to be resolved via the {@link ArgumentResolverService}, however, the following arguments must be resolved via
 * this {@link MessageProcessor}:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link Acknowledge}: this argument can be used to acknowledge that the messages has been successfully processed and can be deleted from the
 *     queue.  If no {@link Acknowledge} argument is included in the argument list of the method, the message will be resolved based on the
 *     execution and return type of the method.</li>
 *     <li>{@link VisibilityExtender}: this argument can be used to extend the visibility of a message if it is taking a long time to process.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A message can be considered a success and therefore deleted from the queue, see {@link MessageResolver}, if one of these scenarios occurs:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>the method has an {@link Acknowledge} field as a parameter, the {@link Acknowledge#acknowledgeSuccessful()} is called in the method and
 *     that is completed successfully</li>
 *     <li>or the method returns a {@link CompletableFuture} which is resolved, the process will call the resolve message callback after this</li>
 *     <li>or the method does not return a {@link CompletableFuture} and executes without throwing an exception, in which the resolve
 *     message callback is called</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If you were to consider this library as similar to a pub-sub system, this could be considered the subscriber executor
 * in that it will take messages provided by the {@link MessageBroker} and provide it to the message listener.
 *
 * <p>As there could be multiple messages all being processed at once, the implementations of this interface must be thread safe.
