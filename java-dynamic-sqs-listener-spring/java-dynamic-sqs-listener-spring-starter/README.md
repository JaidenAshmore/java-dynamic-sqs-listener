# Java Dynamic SQS Listener - Spring Starter
Starter that will auto configure this library to the spring environment when the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation has been applied to your
application.  Note that if you are running in a Spring Boot application and have the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation you do
not need to put the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation as it is already applied.

For the actual Spring configuration see the [java-dynamic-sqs-listener-spring-core](../java-dynamic-sqs-listener-spring-core) module.
