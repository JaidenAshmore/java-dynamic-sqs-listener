# Spring - How to write Integration Tests
This guide provides details on how to write a simple integration test for a spring boot application. Note that writing integration tests through the SQS queue
can be flaky and therefore you should prefer to call your message listener directly in your integration test.

For this How to guide the [Java Dynamic SQS Listener - Spring Integration Test Example](../../../examples/java-dynamic-sqs-listener-spring-integration-test-example)
module will be used. This is very simple application that has a single queue listener that calls out to a service when a message is retrieved. The tests written
includes test on:
 - A message was received and able to be successfully processed
 - A message was received, was not able to be processed and through the re-drive policy succeeded the next time
 - A message was receieved, was not able to be processed after the number of times defined by the re-drive policy where it ended up in the Dead Letter Queue

#### Tools
The tools that will be used to help this are provided by the `local-sqs-test-utils`:
1. [LocalSqsRule](../../../util/local-sqs-test-utils/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/test/LocalSqsRule.java): Test rule that will set up an in-memory ElasticMQ
server. This should be used as a `@ClassRule` in Spring tests so it can be included in the spring application context.
1. [PurgeQueuesRule](../../../util/local-sqs-test-utils/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/test/PurgeQueuesRule.java): Test rule that will purge the messages
from all of the queues present in the SQS Server.

### Examples
The main example that should be used as a reference is the
[SqsListenerExampleIntegrationTest](../../../examples/java-dynamic-sqs-listener-spring-integration-test-example/src/test/java/it/com/jashmore/sqs/examples/integrationtests/SqsListenerExampleIntegrationTest.java)
which will test all of those scenarios described above using the methods described below. Otherwise any of the other integration tests in the spring starter
module would be good examples.

## Steps
1. Include the local-sqs-test-utils maven dependency in the test scope
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.jashmore</groupId>
        <artifactId>local-sqs-test-utils</artifactId>
        <version>${java.dynamic.sqs.listener.version}</version>
        <scope>test</scope> 
    </dependency>
    ```
1. Add the [LocalSqsRule](../../../util/local-sqs-test-utils/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/test/LocalSqsRule.java) as a `ClassRule` to your integration test.
    ```java
    @ClassRule
    public static final LocalSqsRule LOCAL_SQS_RULE = new LocalSqsRule(ImmutableList.of(
            // You should configure the queues that you need for your test here
            SqsQueuesConfig.QueueConfig.builder().queueName("testQueue").build()
    ));
    ```
1. You should probably also add the [PurgeQueuesRule](../../../util/local-sqs-test-utils/src/main/java/com/jashmore/sqs/test/PurgeQueuesRule.java) as a `Rule`
to the integration test so the queues are all purged between tests. This should decrease the amount of flaky tests.
    ```java
    @Rule
    public final PurgeQueuesRule purgeQueuesRule = new PurgeQueuesRule(LOCAL_SQS_RULE.getLocalAmazonSqsAsync());
    ```
1. Add the `LocalSqsAsyncClient` to the context of the spring application by defining a `@Configuration` in your application.
    ```java
    @Configuration
    public static class TestConfiguration {
        @Bean
        public LocalSqsAsyncClient localSqsAsyncClient() {
            return LOCAL_SQS_RULE.getLocalAmazonSqsAsync();
        }
    }
    ```
1. Make sure this Configuration is being included, e.g. by adding it as a class in the `@SpringBootTest` annotation.
    ```java
    @SpringBootTest(classes = {Application.class, IntegrationTest.TestConfiguration.class })
    ```
1. Now you should be able to use this `LocalSqsAsyncClient` to test the queues by manually sending messages onto the queue an asserting that they were procesed.
