## Requirements for the PR
1. Please include in the description a thorough explanation of what you are changing and why this change is necessary.
1. I would prefer to see more comments than less as comments that may not be deemed necessary now could be extremely beneficial for the future for understanding why it was done a certain way.
1. When writing tests, make sure to:
    a. Only test one bit of functionality per test and make sure the name of the test aligns with this
    b. Tests should be split into arrange, act and assert for readability if possible
    c. Unit test coverage should be high and try to cover all edge cases and race conditions
